# MetaDataTransformer
A typescript transpiler wrapper with reflection capabilities

## Important notice
This project is not stable and there are no plans to support the same features as the typescript cli. Maybe when the typescript team has decided on if, how and when they will support easy transformers pluggability I will tear the transformer out of this project and provide it standalone.

## Prerequisites
 - npm

## How to run
 - Open the path "MetaDataTransformer/MetaDataTransformerUsage" in a command line terminal
 - Run `npm run pack`
 - Open "MetaDataTransformer/MetaDataTransformerUsage/test.html" in a browser and take a look at the console output
